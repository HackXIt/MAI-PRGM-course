# Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator

## Overview

Implementing the copy constructor and copy assignment operator is essential when a class manages resources that cannot be copied by default, such as dynamically allocated memory.

## Copy Constructor

- **Purpose**: Initialize a new object as a copy of an existing object.

- **Syntax**:

  ```cpp
  ClassName(const ClassName& other);
  ```

- **Deep vs. Shallow Copy**:

    - **Deep Copy**: Copies the resource pointed to, creating a separate instance.
    - **Shallow Copy**: Copies the pointer value, leading to multiple objects pointing to the same resource.

## Copy Assignment Operator

- **Purpose**: Assign the value from one existing object to another existing object.

- **Syntax**:

  ```cpp
  ClassName& operator=(const ClassName& other);
  ```

- **Self-Assignment Check**: Essential to handle cases where an object is assigned to itself.

  ```cpp
  if (this == &other) return *this;
  ```

## Steps to Implement

1. **Check for Self-Assignment**.
2. **Release Any Resources** the object is holding.
3. **Allocate New Resources** and copy the data.
4. **Return `*this`** to allow chained assignments.

## When to Implement

- When your class manages resources like dynamic memory, file handles, or network connections.
- If the default copy behavior (member-wise copying) is insufficient.

## Implementation

See [copy\_constructor\_assignment.cpp](CopyConstructorAssignment/copy_constructor_assignment.cpp) for code demonstrating how to implement a copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
