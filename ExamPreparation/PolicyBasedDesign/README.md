# Policy-Based Design

## Overview

Policy-based design is a programming technique that uses templates to allow behaviors (policies) to be selected at compile time. It promotes code flexibility and reusability.

## Structure

- **Policy Classes**: Classes that define specific behaviors or strategies.

  ```cpp
  class SortingPolicy {
  public:
      void sortImplementation();
  };
  ```

- **Host Class**: A class template that uses policy classes.

  ```cpp
  template <typename SortingPolicy>
  class Sorter : public SortingPolicy {
  public:
      void sort() {
          this->sortImplementation();
      }
  };
  ```

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Change behaviors without modifying the host class.
- **Compile-Time Optimization**: Decisions are made at compile time, potentially improving performance.
- **Modularity**: Separate different aspects of functionality into independent policies.

## Use Cases

- **Strategy Pattern**: Implement different algorithms or behaviors that can be selected at compile time.
- **Custom Containers**: Define storage and allocation policies.

## Implementation

See [policy\_based\_design.cpp](policy_based_design.cpp) for code demonstrating policy-based design.
